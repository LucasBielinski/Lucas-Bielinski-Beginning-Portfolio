# Bielinski-Portfolio

## Description

This project is a place to display my deployed work, for future employers to look at. I built this project to make it possible to access my work in one place. This makes it quick and easy for a future employer to review my work. I learned how to use more advanced CSS methods in this project. I also learned that CSS is an art, and something I must keep experimenting with.
